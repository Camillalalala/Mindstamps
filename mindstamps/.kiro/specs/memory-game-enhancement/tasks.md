# Memory Game Enhancement Implementation Tasks

## Implementation Plan

Convert the memory game enhancement design into a series of implementation tasks that focus on creating a single-screen, user-friendly experience with proper layout containment and intuitive interactions.

- [ ] 1. Fix Map Container Layout Issues
  - Implement fixed 400px height for map container to prevent overflow
  - Add proper padding and margins to map interface
  - Ensure map stays within right panel boundaries
  - Test map rendering across different screen sizes
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.4, 5.3_

- [ ] 2. Enhance Memory Content Display
  - Implement 80% width utilization for memory content in left panel
  - Add vintage sepia filter to memory images
  - Create scrollable story container with max height constraint
  - Apply paper texture backgrounds to memory containers
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.3, 2.4_

- [ ] 3. Implement Game Action Controls
  - Move submit button to left panel for guaranteed visibility
  - Create guess status display with coordinate feedback
  - Implement result display with score, distance, and location
  - Add clear instructions for users when no guess is made
  - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.2, 3.4_

- [ ] 4. Enhance Map Interaction Feedback
  - Implement blue marker for user guess locations
  - Add red marker for actual memory locations
  - Create dashed line connection between guess and actual locations
  - Ensure map click events register properly for guessing
  - _Requirements: 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.4_

- [ ] 5. Optimize Game State Management
  - Implement proper loading states with cozy animations
  - Create smooth transitions between playing and result states
  - Add game completion flow with multiple action options
  - Handle edge cases for empty memory collections
  - _Requirements: 3.3, 3.5_

- [ ] 6. Implement Responsive Layout System
  - Ensure side-by-side layout works on desktop screens
  - Create mobile-friendly stacked layout for smaller screens
  - Test layout containment across different viewport sizes
  - Maintain cozy design system consistency
  - _Requirements: 5.1, 5.2, 5.3, 5.4_

- [ ] 7. Add Visual Polish and Animations
  - Implement hover effects for interactive elements
  - Add smooth transitions for game state changes
  - Create loading animations with warm color palette
  - Apply consistent typography using journal fonts
  - _Requirements: 2.4, 3.1_

- [ ] 8. Implement Error Handling and Edge Cases
  - Add retry functionality for map loading failures
  - Create fallback displays for missing memory data
  - Implement validation for guess coordinates
  - Add debug information for troubleshooting
  - _Requirements: 3.1, 4.5_

- [ ] 9. Test Game Flow Integration
  - Verify complete game flow from memory loading to completion
  - Test score calculation accuracy and display
  - Validate memory navigation and progression
  - Ensure proper cleanup between game sessions
  - _Requirements: 3.3, 3.5_

- [ ] 10. Optimize Performance and User Experience
  - Implement efficient memory loading and caching
  - Optimize map rendering and interaction responsiveness
  - Add keyboard navigation support where appropriate
  - Test and optimize for various device capabilities
  - _Requirements: 4.1, 5.2_
