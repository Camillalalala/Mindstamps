# Memory Game Enhancement Requirements

## Introduction

This specification outlines the enhancement of the Mindstamps memory guessing game to provide a more engaging and user-friendly experience. The current game allows users to guess locations of their memories, but needs improvements in user interface, scoring system, and overall game flow.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Improved Game Interface

**User Story:** As a user playing the memory game, I want a clean and intuitive interface that fits entirely on my screen, so that I can focus on the game without scrolling or dealing with cut-off content.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user opens the memory game THEN all game elements SHALL be visible within the viewport without scrolling
2. WHEN the user interacts with the map THEN the submit button SHALL always be accessible and visible
3. WHEN the game displays memory content THEN it SHALL use 80% of the left panel width for optimal readability
4. WHEN the map is displayed THEN it SHALL have consistent margins on all sides and not extend beyond its container

### Requirement 2: Enhanced Memory Display

**User Story:** As a user viewing my memory during the game, I want to see my photo, story, and memory details in a beautiful, journal-like format, so that I can fully appreciate my memories while playing.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a memory is displayed THEN it SHALL show the title, image, and story in a cozy, paper-textured container
2. WHEN the memory story is too long THEN it SHALL be scrollable within its container without affecting other elements
3. WHEN displaying the memory image THEN it SHALL have a vintage, sepia-toned filter for aesthetic appeal
4. WHEN showing memory details THEN they SHALL be formatted with proper typography using the journal font family

### Requirement 3: Streamlined Game Flow

**User Story:** As a user playing the memory game, I want clear feedback on my actions and smooth transitions between game states, so that I understand what's happening and can progress naturally through the game.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user clicks on the map THEN they SHALL receive immediate visual feedback showing their guess location
2. WHEN the user makes a guess THEN a "Your Guess Made!" confirmation SHALL appear with coordinates
3. WHEN the user submits a guess THEN the system SHALL show both guess and actual locations with a connecting line
4. WHEN displaying results THEN the score, distance, and location name SHALL be clearly presented
5. WHEN the game ends THEN the user SHALL have clear options to play again, create more memories, or return to journal

### Requirement 4: Map Interaction Improvements

**User Story:** As a user guessing memory locations, I want an interactive world map that's easy to click and provides clear visual feedback, so that I can make accurate guesses and understand the results.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the map loads THEN it SHALL display a world view at appropriate zoom level
2. WHEN the user clicks the map THEN a blue marker SHALL appear at the clicked location
3. WHEN results are revealed THEN a red marker SHALL show the actual location
4. WHEN both markers are visible THEN a dashed red line SHALL connect the guess to the actual location
5. WHEN the map is contained THEN it SHALL have a fixed height of 400px to ensure proper display

### Requirement 5: Responsive Layout Design

**User Story:** As a user accessing Mindstamps on different devices, I want the memory game to work well on various screen sizes, so that I can enjoy the experience regardless of my device.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewed on desktop THEN the game SHALL use a side-by-side layout with memory on left and map on right
2. WHEN viewed on mobile THEN the layout SHALL stack vertically while maintaining usability
3. WHEN the screen size changes THEN all elements SHALL remain properly contained and accessible
4. WHEN using the cozy design system THEN consistent warm colors and paper textures SHALL be maintained across all screen sizes
