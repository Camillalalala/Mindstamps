# Implementation Plan

- [x] 1. Fix MemoryPage edit mode layout to prevent button overlap
  - Restructure the edit mode JSX to use proper flex layout with constrained height
  - Position save/cancel buttons within page content area using flex layout
  - Add CSS constraints to prevent content overflow beyond page boundaries
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 3.1, 3.2, 3.3_

- [x] 2. Add memory identification validation and logging





  - Add console logging in handleEditMemory to track which memory ID is being edited
  - Add validation to ensure the correct memory is being edited
  - Add defensive checks to prevent editing wrong memory
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2, 2.3_

- [x] 3. Improve edit state management and visual feedback





  - Clear editingMemoryId when navigating between pages to prevent stale edit state
  - Add visual indicator to clearly show which memory is being edited
  - Ensure edit state is properly reset when canceling or saving
  - _Requirements: 2.4, 3.4_

- [ ] 4. Test the fixes with multiple memories on same page spread
  - Verify that clicking edit on left memory only edits left memory
  - Verify that clicking edit on right memory only edits right memory
  - Verify that save/cancel buttons don't overlap navigation footer
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 2.1, 2.2_
