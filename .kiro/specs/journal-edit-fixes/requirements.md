# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses critical usability issues in the journal editing interface where save/cancel buttons overlap with navigation controls and incorrect memories are sometimes displayed when editing.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user editing a memory in my journal, I want the save and cancel buttons to be properly positioned within the page content area, so that they don't overlap with the navigation footer.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks edit on a memory THEN the save and cancel buttons SHALL be positioned within the page content area
2. WHEN the edit form is displayed THEN the buttons SHALL NOT overlap with the navigation footer at the bottom
3. WHEN the page content is scrollable THEN the buttons SHALL remain accessible within the page boundaries
4. WHEN switching between edit and view modes THEN the layout SHALL maintain consistent spacing and positioning

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user clicking edit on a specific memory, I want to edit that exact memory, so that I don't accidentally modify the wrong content.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks edit on a memory THEN the system SHALL display the edit form for that specific memory
2. WHEN multiple memories are visible on the same page spread THEN clicking edit SHALL only affect the intended memory
3. WHEN the edit state is active THEN the system SHALL clearly indicate which memory is being edited
4. WHEN canceling an edit THEN the system SHALL return to the exact memory that was being edited

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user editing a memory, I want the edit interface to be contained within the journal page layout, so that the editing experience feels integrated and natural.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN editing a memory THEN the edit form SHALL maintain the same visual boundaries as the view mode
2. WHEN in edit mode THEN the page SHALL still display the journal page styling and structure
3. WHEN editing THEN the form elements SHALL be properly sized to fit within the page content area
4. WHEN saving or canceling THEN the transition back to view mode SHALL be smooth and maintain page position
